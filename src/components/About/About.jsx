                    Hi! I'm a junior at <u>UC Berkeley</u> studying <u>Electrical Engineering and Computer Science</u> ðŸ’».
                    I spent my childhood in the country of enternal spring, <u>Guatemala</u> ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡¹, took flight to the <u>United States</u> for college ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸, and currently am proudly serving in the Air Force in <u>South Korea</u> ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡·.<br /><br />

                    On the professional front, I have a strong interest in <u>backend development</u>, <u>web scraping</u>, and <u>automation</u>. 
                    I've also gained hands-on experience in training and fine-tuning <u>AI</u> models and creating servers to support them. 
                    While my primary focus is on backend work, I have interest in <u>full stack development</u> and enjoy exploring frontend technologies that enhance user experiences.<br /><br />

                    Outside of my studies, Iâ€™m an avid <u>traveler</u> ðŸ›¬, immersing myself in new cultures, indulging in <u>sports</u> like basketball, soccer, and tennis, and savoring diverse <u>cuisines</u> with friends and family. Each adventure fuels my curiosity and broadens my perspective!
